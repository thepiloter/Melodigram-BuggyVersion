## About The Project

This is a purely experimental hobby project that aims to provide a tool for people with no musical background who want to start learning piano.

Unlike most Synthesia-like applications, which are typically built with game engines or multimedia frameworks, I chose Java Swing for all UI-related work.

The goal was to challenge myself and explore how far a traditional GUI framework can be pushed outside its intended scope.

## Features

- **MIDI Playback** â€“ Load and play any standard `.mid` file  
- **Real-time Visualization** â€“ Notes light up on a virtual piano as they are played  
- **Waterfall Animation** â€“ Animated falling notes for easier practice  
- **Live MIDI Input** â€“ Connect your own MIDI keyboard/controller to learn interactively  
- **Playback Controls** â€“ Functional seek bar with full playback control
- **Dragging** - You can drag the animation up and down to traverse the visualization
- **Hand assignment** - You can enter the "Assign Hands" mode, where you can mark hands as left or right by clicking left or right respectively
- **Practice** - You can practice the pieces at your own pace, if you have created a hand assignment for a piece you can practice the parts seperately

## Getting Started

This application is self-contained and does not require you to install Java separately.

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/Tbence132545/Melodigram/releases).
2.  Download the installer for your operating system from the latest release.
3.  Run the executable from inside the folder
   
**The operating system might mark it as dangerous, I just didn't license it**
